# How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, 
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), 
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

- **GitLab**: Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!  
- **GitHub**: Fork this repository and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file.

# Added Features

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Use `_config.yml` to **set whether the homepage tiles should pull pages or posts**, as well as how many to display.
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
* Set **featured images** in front matter.
